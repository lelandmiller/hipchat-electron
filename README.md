# Unofficial HipChat Electron Wrapper

This is just a simple wrapper for the HipChat web app. I started with the
[electron-quick-start](https://github.com/atom/electron-quick-start), which I
retained the license from. Please note that this license *does not* apply to
HipChat, or any of the Atlassian products. I have no connection with Atlassian
whatsoever and HipChat, Atlassian, etc. are all registered trademarks of
Atlassian. This repository simply provides a web browser that points to
HipChat's web client. Super simple.

## Installation

`npm i -g hipchat-electron` will install the package globally,
`hipchat-electron` will then start the application.

## Usage

`npm start` spins up a development instance.

`npm run build` builds with the targets defined in the package.json.
